<Section title="Don't get blocked">

Learn to unblock yourself no matter what, by making a decision, by asking for help fast, by not trying to be perfectionist.

</Section>

<Section title="Don't block others">

Make information public, DMs are the enemy. Ensure everything is properly documented; this can help people to make decisions without even needing to contact you.

</Section>

<Section title="Give it five minutes">

Sometimes you just need a small break before giving your opinion, thats fine. Not everything should be instantaneous.

</Section>

<Section title="Learn to make decisions">

Soon or later you will need to make decisions, alone or in group, with or without pressure, when this happens, it's important to have context enough to make the right decision (Sometimes you will make the wrong decision and this is fine, if you learn with it).

</Section>

<Section title="Be a scout, leave the place you are in better than when you arrived">

This applies to everything; your code, your docs, your desk. Make it better than when you arrived.

</Section>

<Section title="No abstraction is better than the wrong abstraction">

Not everything should be abstracted, it's fine to have two functions that look the same if you don't know where to put it yet.

</Section>

<Section title="Be present">

If you are in a meeting, one of the worst things you can do is not paying enough attention, this will waste everyone's time, put your phone in silence mode, ignore that slack message for a few minutes, it's ok.

</Section>

<Section title="Listen your data">

In all my years of software development this happened countless times, you ask your user for feedback and they answer "I prefer X" but then you look at your data and the user is actually doing Y, they are not lying, they just maybe don't know what they want or what they are doing.
